Problem Description: Given a valid mathematical expression involving '+', '-',' * ', '/', '(' and ')' in a single line, evaluate that expression. (e.g. a rather complicated but valid expression 3 + (8 - 7. 5) * 10 / 5 - (2 + 5 * 7)) should produce -33.0 when evaluated with standard operator precedence.)

Input: Typed into the input document as a seperate line for each different expression.

Output: Displayed on screen.
