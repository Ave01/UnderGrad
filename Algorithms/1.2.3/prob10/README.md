		
Problem description:
Let's define a 'special word' as a lowercase letter followed by two consecutive digits. Given a string, replace all 'special words' of length 3 with 3 stars * * * (no spaces inbetween stars though).Ex: S = "line:a70 and z72 will be replaced, aa24 and a872 will not" should be transformed into: "line: * * * and * * * will be replaced, aa24 and a872 will not"
 
Input: the program is expecting a string with each word or collections of letters/words seperated by spaces. Ex: this a70 b345 w23 h666 fg76 yes 2w2 g55 h93.
 
Output: prints string back out with stars replacing the pattern described above in the problem description. Ex: this * * * b345 * * * h666 fg76 yes 2w2 * * * h93
 
 
Ps: there should be no spaces between the stars. The read me wouldn't let me put them together
