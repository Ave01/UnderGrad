Problem Description: Given the distinct and valid birthdates of n people as triples (DD, MM, YYYY), order them first by ascending birth months (MM), then by ascending birth dates (DD), and finally by ascending age.

Input: The input should be dates in the format "YYYY MM DD" with one date per line, any deviation from this will result in an error. No empty lines allowed.

Output: The output will display the dates sorted the three ways the problem describes with captions: by month, by day, and by age.
