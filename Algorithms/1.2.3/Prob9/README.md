Question 9:
Given a string that represents a base X number, convert it to an equivalent string in base Y, 2 ≤ X,Y ≤ 36.
For example: “FF” in base X = 16 (hexadecimal) is “255” in base Y1 = 10 (decimal) and “11111111” in base Y2 = 2 (binary).
See Section 5.3.2.

Expects value between 0 and F
		Ex. “ff”, “a”, “3”, “92", etc. 

Output: Prints the Decimal value and the Binary Value of the input and throws exception if input is not possible to calculate.
